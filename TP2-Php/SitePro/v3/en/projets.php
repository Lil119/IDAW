            <h4>TIPE Project</h4>
            <p>For the TIPE project of the academic year 2021-2022, I undertook the design
                of an experimental protocol to assess and compare the thermal resistance of
                various materials. This project constituted a thorough exploration of the thermal
                properties of materials, employing precise measurement techniques and specialized
                experimental devices. The protocol design phase required a critical analysis of
                factors influencing thermal resistance, as well as the judicious selection of
                materials to include in the study. Following the experimental phase, results were
                analyzed thoroughly, and significant conclusions were drawn. The 15-minute oral
                presentation before a jury of teacher-researchers provided an opportunity to share
                the methodologies, challenges faced, and major discoveries from this in-depth
                scientific study. This project represented a stimulating opportunity to apply
                theoretical knowledge to practical situations while honing my skills in scientific
                communication.

            <h4 class="text-primary">Encouraging High School Girls Towards Engineering Schools Project</h4>
            <p>My active participation in a project aimed at encouraging high school girls to
                consider a career in engineering was a significant and rewarding experience. Through
                interactive workshops and participation in educational forums, I had the opportunity
                to share my passion for engineering, explain various domains, and demystify
                stereotypes often associated with this profession. The goal was to inspire high
                school girls to explore opportunities in the field of engineering and inform them
                about the various branches of this discipline. Direct interaction with students
                allowed me to answer their questions, share personal experiences, and emphasize the
                importance of diversity in the engineering sector. This project also reinforced my
                belief that education and awareness are powerful tools to encourage young talents to
                consider enriching careers in science and engineering.</p>

            <h4>Female Rugby in Action: Inter-School Tournament</h4>
            <p>As the initiator of a female rugby team, I orchestrated the gathering of
                passionate and determined players to participate in an inter-school tournament. The
                goal was twofold: create an opportunity for women to express themselves in sports
                while fostering an inclusive atmosphere within the world of rugby. Through dedicated
                training coordination and encouragement for collaboration within the team, we formed a
                united and motivated group. This project was much more than just participating in a
                sports competition; it symbolized the desire to diversify the rugby landscape,
                traditionally focused on male teams. The success of this endeavor highlighted the
                ability of women to excel in rugby and contributed to promoting diversity in this
                dynamic sport. The enthusiastic participation of our team in the inter-school
                tournament was a declaration of autonomy, demonstrating that rugby is an accessible
                and welcoming playing field for everyone.</p>
